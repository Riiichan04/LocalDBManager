This is a personal project I started during my summer break. I haven't decided on a final name for the repo yet — for now, it's just LocalDBManager 😄.

## 🚀 Main Features
1. Create, save, and manage your database connections.
2. View all databases and their tables/data from a selected connection.
3. (In progress) Write and execute SQL queries.

It currently has only a few basic features, but I'll continue updating it over time! 💪

## 🛠️ Installation
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Riiichan04/LocalDBManager.git
```

Navigate into the project directory and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note: This project is still in **very early development**. I'm working hard to make it more usable soon!!! 🙏
